## Materials for Evolution 2017

> **NB**: Simulating new data sets and analyzing any of the data files requires
> a few pieces of software. To simulate new data sets using the code provided in the
> tutorial, you will need [`ms`](http://home.uchicago.edu/rhudson1/source/mksamples.html)
> and [`Seq-Gen`](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seqgen/). To analyze the data sets and
> any of the results files you will need to install [**HyDe**](http://hybridization-detection.rtfd.io).

### HyDe Tutorial

The file `HyDe.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook with a walkthrough of the analyses
that we conducted as part of our talks at Evolution.

### Data Files

 - `data.txt` and `map.txt`: these are simulated data sets that ca be during these
   the tutorial to test out the different features of HyDe. The code to generate
   them is in the `HyDe.ipynb` notebook.

 - `heliconius-out.txt` and `heliconius-boot.txt`: these are the results files from
   our analysis of the _Heliconius_ data set from Martin _et al_. (2013).

 - `swordtail-out.txt`: this is the result file from our analysis of the swordtail
   data set from Cui _et al_ (2013).
